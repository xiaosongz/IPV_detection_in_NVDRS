# Stream B Progress: Performance Benchmarking and Load Testing

**Stream**: Performance Benchmarking and Load Testing  
**Issue**: #6 Integration Testing and Performance Validation  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  
**Last Updated**: 2025-08-29

## Completed Tasks

### ✅ Performance Test Files Created

1. **`tests/performance/integration_benchmarks.R`** - Comprehensive component benchmarking
   - Parsing performance testing (>500 responses/second target)
   - Storage performance testing (>5000 inserts/second PostgreSQL target) 
   - Query performance testing (<10ms target)
   - Uses real NVDRS narrative data for realistic testing
   - Generates comprehensive performance reports
   - Validates all performance targets against production requirements

2. **`tests/performance/load_testing.R`** - High-volume load testing framework
   - Tests with 1000+ real narrative samples (expandable to 2000+)
   - High-volume batch processing validation
   - Concurrent database access testing
   - Stress testing with error scenarios
   - Memory stress testing during heavy loads
   - Network resilience testing
   - Comprehensive load test reporting

3. **`tests/performance/memory_profiling.R`** - Memory leak detection and profiling
   - Memory usage profiling for parsing operations
   - Storage operation memory efficiency testing

   - Linear scaling validation (memory grows appropriately with batch size)
   - Peak memory usage validation (<2GB for 10k records target)
   - Garbage collection effectiveness monitoring

### ✅ Test Data Integration

- **Real NVDRS Data Usage**: All tests use real narrative samples from `data-raw/suicide_IPV_manuallyflagged.xlsx`
