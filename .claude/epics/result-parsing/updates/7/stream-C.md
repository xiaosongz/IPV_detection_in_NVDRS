# Stream C: Function Documentation Enhancement

## Scope
Complete roxygen2 documentation with examples and generate man pages

## Files
- `R/*.R` (add @examples sections)
- `man/*.Rd` (generated)

## Progress
- ✅ Reviewed all R functions to identify missing @examples sections
- ✅ Added comprehensive @examples to db_utils.R functions
  - get_db_connection, connect_postgres, close_db_connection
  - test_connection_health, ensure_schema
- ✅ Added @examples to store_llm_result.R functions
  - store_llm_result with basic and connection reuse patterns
  - store_llm_results_batch with performance optimization examples
- ✅ Added @examples to experiment_utils.R functions  
  - register_prompt with version management workflow
  - start_experiment with complete experiment lifecycle
- ✅ Added @examples to experiment_analysis.R functions
  - experiment_metrics showing performance analysis
  - compare_experiments with statistical testing
- ✅ Added @examples to utils.R utility functions
  - %||% operator with NULL coalescing examples
  - trimws_safe with NULL handling examples
- ✅ Generated updated man pages using devtools::document()
- ✅ Verified documentation build without roxygen2 warnings
- ✅ Committed all changes with proper issue format

## Results
- Added @examples sections to 15+ exported functions
- Generated 35 comprehensive man pages
- All examples use \dontrun{} blocks following R package conventions  
- Examples demonstrate practical usage patterns and Unix philosophy
- Documentation follows tidyverse style guide
- No roxygen2 warnings or errors during generation

## Implementation Notes
- Examples focus on real-world usage patterns
- Database functions show both SQLite and PostgreSQL usage
- Experiment functions demonstrate complete R&D workflow
- Error handling patterns included in examples
- Connection management best practices highlighted
- Examples are runnable and follow package conventions
