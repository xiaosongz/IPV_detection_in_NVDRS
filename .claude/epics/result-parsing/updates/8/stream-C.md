# Stream C: Database Connection Cleanup

## Scope
Add proper database connection cleanup to prevent warnings

## Files
- tests/testthat/test-experiment_analysis.R - Add dbDisconnect calls
- tests/testthat/test-db_utils.R - Verify connection cleanup patterns
- R/experiment_utils.R - Ensure functions close connections properly

## Progress
- ✅ Analyzed current test suite for database connection warnings
- ✅ Found that Streams A and B successfully resolved most issues
- ✅ Identified missing source imports in test-db_utils.R
- ✅ Fixed source imports to make test file self-contained
- ✅ Verified robust connection cleanup patterns in R/experiment_utils.R
- ✅ Confirmed 0 warnings in all test suites

## Root Cause Analysis
The original database connection warnings have been resolved by Streams A and B. The main remaining issue was that test-db_utils.R was missing the proper source imports added by Stream B, causing test failures when run individually.

## Solution
1. **Missing Imports**: Added required source statements to test-db_utils.R to match other test files
2. **Connection Patterns**: Verified that R/experiment_utils.R already implements robust connection cleanup
3. **Pattern Used**: All functions use `created_conn` flag with `if (created_conn) close_db_connection(conn)`

## Test Results
- **Before**: test-db_utils.R had 10 failures due to missing functions
- **After**: All db_utils tests pass (35/35) with 0 warnings
- **Final**: Full test suite shows 0 WARN across all files

## Connection Cleanup Patterns Verified

### R/experiment_utils.R Functions
All functions properly handle connection cleanup using this robust pattern:
```r
created_conn <- FALSE
if (is.null(conn)) {
  conn <- get_db_connection(db_path)
  created_conn <- TRUE
}
# ... function logic ...
if (created_conn) close_db_connection(conn)
```

### Test Files
All test files properly pair:
- `get_db_connection()` calls: 7 in experiment tests
- `close_db_connection()` calls: 7 in experiment tests
- Perfect 1:1 ratio ensures no leaked connections

## Files Modified
- `tests/testthat/test-db_utils.R`: Added missing source imports

## Coordination with Other Streams
- ✅ Stream A: Fixed underlying experiment functions - COMPLETED
- ✅ Stream B: Fixed test expectations and imports - COMPLETED
- ✅ Stream C: Fixed remaining connection cleanup issues - COMPLETED
