## Description
Fix 19 failing tests in the experiment_analysis test suite after implementing experiment tracking (Issue #4) and PostgreSQL support (Issue #5).

## Problem
- 19 failures in `test-experiment_analysis.R`
- Main issues:
  - `experiment_report()` function output format
  - Report generation tests expecting specific text patterns
  - Database connection cleanup warnings

## Current Test Status
- ✅ build_prompt: 77 tests passing
- ✅ call_llm: 17 tests passing  
- ✅ db_utils: 35 tests passing
- ✅ detect_ipv: 25 tests passing
- ⚠️ experiment_analysis: 101 passing, 19 failing

## Tasks
- [ ] Fix experiment_report() to generate expected output format
- [ ] Update test expectations to match actual output
- [ ] Add proper database connection cleanup in tests
- [ ] Ensure all experiment tracking functions work correctly
- [ ] Verify integration with both SQLite and PostgreSQL backends

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All experiment_analysis tests pass
- [ ] No database connection warnings
- [ ] Report generation works as expected
- [ ] Both SQLite and PostgreSQL backends tested

## Technical Details
- Failures are in auxiliary functions, not core functionality
- Experiment tracking system works but needs test refinement
- Minor fixes to report generation needed

## Priority
Medium - Core functionality works, this is test cleanup and minor fixes

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 2-3 hours
- Parallel: true (can fix different aspects simultaneously)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All 19 failing tests pass
- [ ] No connection cleanup warnings
- [ ] Tests work with both database backends
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed
