## Original Description
Create comprehensive integration tests that validate the complete workflow from `call_llm()` through parsing to database storage. Test SQLite backend with real IPV detection data, validate performance targets, and ensure the system works reliably in production scenarios.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] End-to-end integration tests for complete workflow
- [ ] Performance benchmarks for all components meet targets
- [ ] Load testing with 1000+ real narrative samples
- [ ] Error scenario testing (network failures, malformed responses)
- [ ] Memory usage validation (no leaks during batch processing)
- [ ] Concurrent access testing for PostgreSQL
- [ ] Documentation of performance characteristics

## Technical Details
- Create `tests/integration/test_full_workflow.R`
- Use real data from `data-raw/suicide_IPV_manuallyflagged.xlsx`
- Test both database backends with identical data
- Benchmark parsing, storage, and query performance
- Simulate error conditions and validate recovery
- Memory profiling for large batch operations
- Concurrent write testing for PostgreSQL

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 002 completed (parser function)
- [ ] Task 003 completed (SQLite storage)
- [ ] Task 004 completed (PostgreSQL storage) 
- [ ] Test dataset available

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 12-16 hours
- Parallel: true (can run once core components are ready)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Integration test suite covering all scenarios
- [ ] All performance targets validated and documented
- [ ] Error handling tested and verified
- [ ] Memory usage profiled and optimized
- [ ] Load testing completed with real data
- [ ] Performance documentation updated
- [ ] Both database backends validated in production scenarios
