# Parallel Work Analysis: Issue #4

## Overview
Implement SQLite storage layer with database schema, connection utilities, and the `store_llm_result()` function. The work can be divided into infrastructure setup, core functionality, and testing/optimization streams.

## Parallel Streams

### Stream A: Database Infrastructure
**Scope**: Database connection utilities and schema management
**Files**:
- `R/db_utils.R`
- `inst/sql/schema.sql`
- `inst/sql/migrations/`
**Agent Type**: database-admin
**Can Start**: immediately
**Estimated Hours**: 6
**Dependencies**: none

### Stream B: Core Storage Function
**Scope**: Main storage function and business logic
**Files**:
- `R/store_llm_result.R`
- `R/store_helpers.R` (if needed for duplicate detection)
**Agent Type**: backend-architect
**Can Start**: after Stream A creates schema
**Estimated Hours**: 8
**Dependencies**: Stream A (needs schema definition)

### Stream C: Testing and Performance
**Scope**: Comprehensive test suite and performance benchmarking
**Files**:
- `tests/testthat/test-store_llm_result.R`
- `tests/testthat/test-db_utils.R`
- `tests/testthat/fixtures/sample_parsed_results.R`
- `tests/performance/benchmark_storage.R`
**Agent Type**: test-automator
**Can Start**: after Stream B completes
**Estimated Hours**: 4
**Dependencies**: Streams A and B

## Coordination Points

### Shared Files
None - streams work on completely separate files

### Sequential Requirements
1. Database schema must be defined before storage function implementation
2. Connection utilities must exist before storage function can use them
3. Core functions must exist before comprehensive testing

## Conflict Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Each stream works on different R files and directories
- No shared files between streams
- Clear separation of concerns

## Parallelization Strategy

**Recommended Approach**: hybrid

Start Stream A immediately to establish database infrastructure. Once schema is defined (2-3 hours into Stream A), Stream B can begin working on the storage function while Stream A continues with migrations and advanced utilities. Stream C starts once Stream B has the basic function working.

## Expected Timeline

With parallel execution:
- Wall time: ~10 hours
- Total work: 18 hours
- Efficiency gain: 44%

Without parallel execution:
- Wall time: 18 hours

## Notes

### Implementation Priorities
1. Follow Unix philosophy - single table, simple design
2. Focus on SQLite as the zero-configuration option
3. Ensure auto-schema creation works smoothly
4. Performance target of >1000 inserts/second is critical

### Key Technical Decisions
- Use DBI for database abstraction
- RSQLite for SQLite backend
- Single table design (`llm_results`)
- Proper indexing for query performance
- Schema versioning for future migrations

### Risk Mitigation
- Stream A should create a simple working schema first, then enhance
- Stream B should implement basic storage before optimization
- Stream C should start with basic tests, then add performance benchmarks
