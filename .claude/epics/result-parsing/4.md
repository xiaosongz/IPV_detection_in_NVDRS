# Task: Create Database Schema and SQLite Storage

## Description
Implement database schema and SQLite storage layer with `store_llm_result()` function. Create single-table design following Unix philosophy, with auto-schema creation, proper indexing, and connection management utilities. Focus on SQLite backend first as the simple, zero-configuration option.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Database schema designed and documented (single table approach)
- [ ] Function `store_llm_result()` implemented for SQLite
- [ ] Auto-create tables on first use with proper indexes  
- [ ] Connection utilities in `R/db_utils.R` (SQLite functions)
- [ ] Schema versioning and migration support
- [ ] Duplicate detection and handling strategy
- [ ] Performance target: >1000 inserts/second for batch operations
- [ ] Comprehensive test suite with real data

## Technical Details
- Create `R/store_llm_result.R` with storage function
- Create `R/db_utils.R` with SQLite connection helpers
- Single table `llm_results` with all fields from parsed data
- Use DBI interface for database abstraction
- RSQLite package for SQLite backend
- Implement `ensure_schema()` function for table creation
- Include proper SQL indexing for query performance

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 002 completed (parser function available)
- [ ] Parsed result structure defined
- [ ] RSQLite and DBI packages

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 16-20 hours  
- Parallel: false (depends on Task 002)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] SQLite storage function fully implemented
- [ ] Database schema created with proper indexes
- [ ] Connection utilities working reliably
- [ ] Auto-schema creation and versioning implemented
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet targets (>1000 inserts/sec)
- [ ] Test suite covers all scenarios including edge cases
- [ ] Integration tested with parser output
