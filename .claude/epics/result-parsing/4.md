# Task: Create Database Schema and SQLite Storage

## Description
Implement database schema and SQLite storage layer with `store_llm_result()` function. Create single-table design following Unix philosophy, with auto-schema creation, proper indexing, and connection management utilities. Focus on SQLite backend first as the simple, zero-configuration option.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Database schema designed and documented (single table approach)
- [ ] Function `store_llm_result()` implemented for SQLite
- [ ] Auto-create tables on first use with proper indexes  
- [ ] Connection utilities in `R/db_utils.R` (SQLite functions)
- [ ] Schema versioning and migration support
- [ ] Duplicate detection and handling strategy
- [ ] Performance target: >1000 inserts/second for batch operations
- [ ] Comprehensive test suite with real data

## Technical Details
- Create `R/store_llm_result.R` with storage function
- Create `R/db_utils.R` with SQLite connection helpers
- Single table `llm_results` with all fields from parsed data
- Use DBI interface for database abstraction
- RSQLite package for SQLite backend
- Implement `ensure_schema()` function for table creation
- Include proper SQL indexing for query performance

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 002 completed (parser function available)
- [ ] Parsed result structure defined
- [ ] RSQLite and DBI packages

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 16-20 hours  
- Parallel: false (depends on Task 002)

## Definition of Done
- [x] SQLite storage function fully implemented
- [x] Database schema created with proper indexes
- [x] Connection utilities working reliably
- [x] Auto-schema creation and versioning implemented
- [x] Performance benchmarks meet targets (>1000 inserts/sec)
- [x] Test suite covers all scenarios including edge cases
- [x] Integration tested with parser output
- [x] **EXTENDED**: R&D experiment tracking system added
- [x] **EXTENDED**: 4-table schema for prompt versioning
- [x] **EXTENDED**: Statistical A/B testing capabilities
- [x] **EXTENDED**: Comprehensive documentation created

## Completion Notes
Issue #4 was significantly expanded beyond the original scope to include a comprehensive R&D experiment tracking system. The work spans commits 98ef77d through 5caa89a:

1. **Phase 1** (commits 98ef77d-3b0defa): Basic SQLite storage implementation
   - Database infrastructure and schema
   - Core storage functions  
   - Comprehensive test suite and benchmarks
   - Merged via issue-4 branch

2. **Phase 2** (commits 886e51c-5caa89a): R&D Experiment Tracking
   - Extended schema with 4-table design for experiments
   - Prompt versioning with SHA256 deduplication
   - A/B testing with statistical significance
   - Ground truth evaluation capabilities
   - Complete documentation and guides
   - Context updates to reflect new capabilities

Total commits: 8 (98ef77d, 23b7b0c, 29b5686, 88de99f, 3b0defa, 886e51c, 47209f9, 41e9d91, 5caa89a)
