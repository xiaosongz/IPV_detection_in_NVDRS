# Task: Add PostgreSQL Storage Support [CLOSED - Won't Do]

## Closure Reason
This task contradicts the project's Unix philosophy of radical simplicity. The project maintains a "30 lines of code" approach and PostgreSQL support would add unnecessary complexity. Users who need PostgreSQL can implement their own wrapper around the simple functions provided.

## Original Description
Extend the storage layer to support PostgreSQL backend for production deployments. Modify `store_llm_result()` to work with PostgreSQL connections, add PostgreSQL-specific connection utilities, and optimize schema for concurrent access and large-scale storage.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `store_llm_result()` function works with PostgreSQL connections
- [ ] PostgreSQL connection utilities added to `db_utils.R`
- [ ] Schema optimized for PostgreSQL (proper data types, constraints)
- [ ] Connection pooling and concurrent access support
- [ ] Performance target: >5000 inserts/second with proper indexing
- [ ] Production deployment documentation
- [ ] Environment variable configuration support

## Technical Details
- Extend `R/store_llm_result.R` to detect connection type (SQLite vs PostgreSQL)
- Add PostgreSQL functions to `R/db_utils.R`
- Use RPostgres package for PostgreSQL backend
- Optimize schema for PostgreSQL-specific features
- Add connection string handling with environment variables
- Document production setup and configuration

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 003 completed (SQLite storage working)
- [ ] RPostgres package available
- [ ] PostgreSQL server for testing (optional, can mock)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 8-12 hours
- Parallel: true (extends existing storage, minimal conflicts)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] PostgreSQL storage fully functional
- [ ] Connection utilities handle both backends transparently
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet targets (>5000 inserts/sec)
- [ ] Production documentation complete
- [ ] Environment-based configuration working
- [ ] Test suite covers PostgreSQL-specific scenarios
- [ ] Backwards compatibility with SQLite maintained
