# Project Brief

## Executive Summary
A minimalist R function that detects intimate partner violence (IPV) in death investigation narratives using Large Language Models. Following Unix philosophy, the entire solution is 30 lines of code.

## Problem Statement

### The Challenge
Public health researchers need to identify IPV-related deaths in large datasets of death investigation narratives. Manual review is:
- Time-consuming (hours per case)
- Expensive (requires trained coders)
- Inconsistent (inter-rater variability)
- Unscalable (thousands of cases annually)

### Current Solutions Inadequate
- **Manual Coding**: Gold standard but impractical at scale
- **Keyword Search**: Too simplistic, misses context
- **Complex NLP**: Over-engineered, hard to maintain
- **Commercial Tools**: Expensive, black-box, inflexible

## Solution Approach

### Core Concept
One function that sends narrative text to an LLM and returns IPV detection results. That's it.

### Key Innovation
**Radical Simplicity** - Rejected 10,000+ lines of framework code for 30 lines that do the job.

### Technical Approach
```r
Text → LLM API → Structured Response → Result
```

## Project Scope

### In Scope
✅ Detect IPV indicators in text narratives
✅ Return confidence scores
✅ Handle errors gracefully
✅ Work with any OpenAI-compatible API

### Out of Scope
❌ Data management
❌ User interface
❌ Workflow orchestration
❌ Result storage
❌ Authentication systems
❌ Progress tracking

## Success Criteria

### Functional Success
- [x] Accurately detect IPV (~70% agreement with manual)
- [x] Process narratives quickly (2-5/second)
- [x] Handle missing/invalid data gracefully
- [x] Work with local or cloud LLMs

### Design Success
- [x] Under 50 lines of code
- [x] Zero framework dependencies
- [x] User controls everything
- [x] Clear, readable implementation

### User Success
- [x] Copy-paste installation
- [x] Immediate productivity
- [x] No learning curve
- [x] Complete control

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- Requires R environment
- Needs LLM API access
- Limited by API rate limits
- Token limits on narrative length

### Assumptions
- Users know R basics
- Users have data ready
- LLM provides consistent format
- Network connectivity available

## Timeline & Milestones

### Completed Milestones
- ✅ Initial complex implementation (10,000+ lines)
- ✅ Testing with 289 cases
- ✅ Achieved 70% accuracy
- ✅ Radical simplification to 30 lines
- ✅ Documentation and examples

### Current Status
**COMPLETE** - Tool is functional and available

## Resources

### Dependencies
- R (language)
- httr2 (HTTP client)
- jsonlite (JSON parsing)
- LLM API (LM Studio or similar)

### Documentation
- README.md - User guide
- CLAUDE.md - Development guide
- Example code in docs/

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| API changes | Medium | Use standard OpenAI format |
| LLM availability | High | Support multiple providers |
| Token limits | Low | User can chunk text |

### User Risks
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Misuse for diagnosis | High | Clear documentation |
| Over-reliance | Medium | Emphasize validation |
| Data privacy | High | Local LLM option |
