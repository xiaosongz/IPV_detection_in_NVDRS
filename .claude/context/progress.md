# Project Progress

## Current Status
- **Branch**: dev_c (up to date with origin/dev_c)
- **Working Tree**: Clean
- **Last Commit**: 72941e0 - "Simplify to Unix philosophy: 30-line implementation"

## Recent Accomplishments

### Latest Refactoring (Complete)
Successfully simplified entire IPV detection system from 10,000+ lines to a single 30-line function following Unix philosophy:
- ✅ Removed all unnecessary abstractions and frameworks
- ✅ Implemented pure functional approach with `detect_ipv()` 
- ✅ Eliminated complex R package structure
- ✅ User now controls all workflow aspects (loops, parallelization, error handling)
- ✅ Updated README and CLAUDE.md to reflect minimalist philosophy

### Previous Milestones
1. **Unix Philosophy Implementation** - Reduced entire codebase to essential 30 lines
2. **Full Dataset Testing** - Completed testing on all 289 available cases
3. **Forensic Analysis System** - Implemented advanced IPV detection with directionality
4. **Unified Prompt Template** - Standardized LLM interaction patterns
5. **Configuration System** - Externalized all settings via environment variables

## Current State

### Core Implementation
- **Primary File**: `docs/ULTIMATE_CLEAN.R` (30 lines)
- **Alternative**: `docs/CLEAN_IMPLEMENTATION.R` (100 lines with batching)
- **Philosophy**: Do ONE thing well - detect IPV in text
- **Dependencies**: Minimal - only httr2 and jsonlite

### Test Data
- **Location**: `data-raw/suicide_IPV_manuallyflagged.xlsx`
- **Records**: 289 cases with manual IPV flags
- **Validation**: ~70% accuracy achieved in testing

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. Document usage patterns for common workflows
2. Create simple example scripts for batch processing
3. Test with different LLM providers beyond LM Studio
4. Validate performance with larger datasets

### Potential Enhancements (User-Controlled)
- Example parallel processing scripts
- Template for custom prompt engineering
- Sample error handling wrappers
- Performance benchmarking utilities

## Technical Debt
- None - simplified to essential functionality only

## Known Issues
- LM Studio sometimes returns incomplete JSON (handled with tryCatch)
- Some narratives exceed token limits (user should chunk if needed)
- Test data in Excel format, not CSV (user can convert as needed)

## Development Philosophy
Following Linus Torvalds' principles:
- Good taste = eliminating special cases
- Simplicity over features
- User control over framework magic
- Clear, understandable code over abstractions
