# Project Vision

## Core Vision
**"Complex problems don't require complex solutions"**

A world where researchers can detect IPV in narratives without frameworks, platforms, or vendor lock-in. Just a function that works.

## Philosophy

### The Unix Way
> "Write programs that do one thing and do it well. Write programs to work together. Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface." - Doug McIlroy

This project embodies these principles:
- **One Thing**: Detect IPV in text
- **Work Together**: Composable with any R workflow
- **Text Streams**: Simple input/output

### The Linus Standard
Following Linus Torvalds' concept of "good taste":
- Eliminate special cases
- Remove unnecessary abstraction
- Make the common case fast
- Keep it stupidly simple

## Long-Term Goals

### Maintain Simplicity
- **Minimal code**: Core function stays focused and clean
- **Zero frameworks**: No architectural astronautics
- **User ownership**: They control their destiny

### Enable Research
- **Accessibility**: Any R user can use it
- **Transparency**: Logic is visible and modifiable
- **Reproducibility**: Simple to replicate results

### Community Impact
- **Open Science**: Fully open source
- **No Barriers**: No licensing, no fees
- **Fork-Friendly**: Encourage customization

## What Success Looks Like

### Technical Success
```r
# In 2030, still just this:
result <- detect_ipv("narrative text")
```

### Research Success
- Thousands of papers cite the tool
- IPV patterns discovered through scale
- Prevention programs informed by data
- Lives saved through better understanding

### Community Success
- Forks for specific use cases
- Shared prompt improvements
- Cross-discipline adoption
- Global research collaboration

## Future Possibilities (User-Driven)

### Potential Extensions Users Might Create
- Domain-specific versions (child abuse, elder abuse)
- Multi-language support
- Custom confidence thresholds
- Integration with research pipelines



## Strategic Priorities

### Priority 1: Simplicity
- Reject feature requests
- Remove code when possible
- Maintain clarity
- Preserve minimalism

### Priority 2: Reliability
- Consistent behavior
- Predictable errors
- Stable interface
- No breaking changes

### Priority 3: Freedom
- User controls everything
- No vendor lock-in
- Fork encouraged
- Modification expected

## Impact Vision

### Public Health Impact
- Enable population-level IPV surveillance
- Identify risk factors and patterns
- Inform prevention strategies
- Support evidence-based policy

### Research Impact
- Democratize large-scale text analysis
- Reduce research costs
- Accelerate discovery
- Enable reproducible science

### Social Impact
- Better understanding of IPV
- Improved prevention programs
- More informed interventions
- Ultimately, fewer deaths

## Sustainability Model

### Technical Sustainability
- No maintenance burden (minimal code)
- No dependencies to update
- No security vulnerabilities
- No technical debt

### Community Sustainability
- Users maintain their versions
- Forks for special needs
- Community shares improvements
- No central authority needed

### Financial Sustainability
- No funding required
- No infrastructure costs
- No support burden
- Completely self-sustaining

## Inspiration & Influence

### Projects We Admire
- **grep**: Simple, powerful, composable
- **curl**: Does one thing perfectly
- **jq**: JSON processing made simple
- **SQLite**: Serverless simplicity

### What We Reject
- Enterprise frameworks
- Platform thinking
- Vendor lock-in
- Feature creep
- Complexity worship


### Why This Matters
Every line of code is:
- A potential bug
- Maintenance burden
- Learning requirement
- Barrier to entry
- Constraint on users

## Call to Action

### For Researchers
1. Use the function
2. Modify for your needs
3. Share your improvements
4. Publish your findings

### For Developers
1. Fork it
2. Adapt it
3. Keep it simple
4. Respect the philosophy

### For Public Health
1. Enable surveillance
2. Identify patterns
3. Inform policy
4. Prevent violence

## Closing Thought

> "Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away." - Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry

The vision is not to grow, but to remain perfectly simple while enabling complex research.
