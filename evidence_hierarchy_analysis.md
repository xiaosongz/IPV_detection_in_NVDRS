# Evidence Reliability Analysis for IPV Detection

## Critical Evidence Indicators (Reliability 0.85-0.95)

### Strangulation Evidence (0.95)
- Petechiae (small blood spots in eyes)
- Ligature marks on neck
- Fingernail scratches on neck/throat
- **Why highly reliable**: Strangulation rarely accidental, strong IPV predictor

### Defensive Wounds (0.90) 
- Cuts/bruises on hands, forearms, palms
- Broken fingernails
- DNA under victim's fingernails
- **Why highly reliable**: Clear indication of struggle, resistance

### Multiple Healing Stages (0.88)
- Injuries in different phases of healing
- Old scars plus fresh wounds
- Medical records showing pattern
- **Why highly reliable**: Indicates chronic abuse over time

## Moderate Evidence Indicators (Reliability 0.65-0.84)

### Legal Documentation (0.85)
- Active restraining orders
- Prior domestic violence arrests
- Court records of threats
- **Why moderately high**: Legal system verification

### Witness Statements (0.80)
- Third-party reports of threats
- Neighbor accounts of disputes
- Family reports of fear/control
- **Why reliable**: External corroboration

### Help-Seeking Behavior (0.75)
- Shelter contacts
- Counseling records
- Police calls for help
- **Why reliable**: Consistent with IPV patterns

## Lower Reliability Indicators (0.45-0.64)

### Circumstantial Context (0.50-0.60)
- Shared residence location
- Recent relationship changes  
- Weapon availability
- **Why lower**: Common in many relationships

## Confidence Calibration Formula

```
Base Confidence = Weighted Sum of Evidence Reliability Scores
Adjustment Factors:
- Contradictions: -0.1 to -0.3 per major contradiction
- Missing Information: -0.05 to -0.2 based on criticality
- Narrative Quality: +/- 0.1 based on completeness

Final Confidence = Base Confidence Ã— Quality Multiplier
```

## Recommended Thresholds

- **High Confidence IPV (0.8+)**: Multiple physical indicators OR strong physical + behavioral
- **Moderate Confidence (0.6-0.8)**: Single strong physical OR multiple behavioral  
- **Low Confidence (0.4-0.6)**: Multiple circumstantial OR weak physical
- **Insufficient Evidence (<0.4)**: Minimal or contradictory evidence
