# Email to Andrea - Production Analysis Complete

**Date:** 2025-10-30

Hi Andrea,

Great news - we finished the LLM part! I got the production run completed and put together a comprehensive report.

## Report Ready for Review

The analysis is all documented in:
- **Report:** `docs/analysis/20251030-production_report.html`
- **Source code:** `docs/analysis/20251030-production_report.Rmd` (if you want to see how it's built)

The report covers all the details - data quality, detection patterns, confidence analysis, etc. I think it's ready to share with the team once you've had a look.

## Next Steps

Could you take a look at the report before share it to everyone? Would love your feedback on:
- Does it make sense for our research audience?
- Any red flags or things I missed?
- Good to go for team sharing?

Also - I'm going to send another update to the team about our ITS-AI meeting yesterday. The PIs seem excited to move forward, which is awesome! If they give the green light, we'll probably need PM help with the IRB amendment for the next phase (manual labeling/validation).

Let me know what you think when you get a chance to look it over!

Thanks,

Xiaosong
