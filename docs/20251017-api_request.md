Subject: API Key Request for Research Project: Intimate Partner Violence Detection

Dear University of Michigan ITS-AI Team,

I am writing to request an API key for the UM-GPT service to support a research project focused on the detection of Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) from textual narratives.

Our project aims to leverage large language models to automatically identify instances of IPV in de-identified narratives. This work is crucial for improving the efficiency and accuracy of IPV surveillance, which can ultimately help in directing resources and interventions more effectively.

The data we will be using is fully de-identified to protect the privacy and confidentiality of all individuals. In our narratives, all identifying information has been removed and replaced with generic placeholders. For example:

*   All victim names are replaced with "V/victim".
*   Individuals are referred to by their relationship to the victim (e.g., "V's boyfriend", "V's mother").
*   No specific names, locations, or absolute dates are included.
*   Time is described in relative terms (e.g., "two days later", "a few months ago").

Here is a brief, fabricated example of what our de-identified narratives look like:

> "The reporting person stated that a few months ago, V/victim was in a verbal argument with V's boyfriend at their shared residence. The argument escalated, and the boyfriend pushed V/victim, causing V/victim to fall. Two days later, V/victim told V's sister about the incident."

We would like to use the UM-GPT API to send these narratives and receive a classification indicating whether IPV is present. Access to the API would be instrumental for our research, allowing us to perform this classification task at scale and evaluate the effectiveness of different LLM models for this important public health issue.

Thank you for considering our request. Please let me know if you require any further information.

Sincerely,

[Your Name/Lab/Department]
